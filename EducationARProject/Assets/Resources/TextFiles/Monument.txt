Monument to the founders of Kiev - Kiyu, Schek, Horiv and their sister Lybid was established in 1982 in honor of the 1500th anniversary of Kiev in Navodnitsky Park (until 1993 - the park named after VM Primakov) near the Patona Bridge. The official name of the monument is "The floating Lybid", although most often it is called "a monument to the founders of Kiev" or simply "Rook".

The legend says that the princes Kiy, Shchek, Horyv and their sister Lybid founded the city on the right bank of the Dnieper and named it in honor of their elder brother Kiev. As Nestor the Chronicler wrote in The Tale of Bygone Years: "And there were three brothers: one, named Kiy, and the other - Shchek, and the third - Horeb, and their sister Lybid. Kiy was sitting on the mountain, where the descent was now Borichev, and Shchek was sitting on the mountain, which is now called Shchekovitsa, and Horeb is on the third mountain, which was nicknamed Horyvitsa. And they built the city in the name of their elder brother and called it Kiev. "
